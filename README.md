# InventoriesMysql

**InventoriesMysql** is an SQL dump for creating an inventory database. The project is designed for tracking and managing items, their categories, and locations.

## Database Structure
The database consists of three main tables:
- **categories** – categories of items (e.g., furniture, computer equipment, household appliances).
- **locations** – locations where items are stored (e.g., director's office, office 204, teachers' lounge).
- **items** – a list of items with category, location, description, and creation date.

## Usage
The project can be used for automating inventory tracking in offices, educational institutions, and other organizations. The database is easy to integrate with web applications and resource management systems.
